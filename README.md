### About
Every year, Discord nuking bots get stronger and stronger every year. This is a demonstration of the powers of Discord nuking bots and what they can do. This is not the fastest and can be optimized more. This bot was made for educational purposes only and ease of use while also making it harder to simply skid.

### Usage
To use the demo code in your own server, follow the steps below.

> [!NOTE]
> [You need to download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your system in order to use this project.

1. Create a new folder on your system (it can be called anything)
2. [Download the bot.js file](https://github.com/peretashacking/atom/blob/main/src/bot.js) and [download the .env file](https://github.com/peretashacking/atom/blob/main/src/.env) and move both files into your folder
3. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application
4. In the Bot tab, get the token and copy it to your clipboard.
5. In the folder, open the .env file and change `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` to the bot token of your bot
6. Invite the bot to a new server that you can destroy and mess around with - all actions are destructive!
7. Open your terminal and run the following commands:
```node
npm install discord.js dotenv
```
8. These will install all required dependencies. When they are finished installing, run this command to start the bot
```node
node bot.js
```

If you get an error like the one below, make sure you are in the correct directory.
```node
node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1148
  throw err;
  ^

Error: Cannot find module '/Users/mike/atom/bot.js'
    at Module._resolveFilename (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1145:15)
    at Module._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:986:27)
    at Function.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (node:internal/modules/run_main:174:12)
    at node:internal/main/run_main_module:28:49 {
  code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND',
  requireStack: []
}
```

To get started using the bot, run the command `>help` in any channel in the server.

## ATTENTION SKIDS!
DO NOT STEAL THIS BOT! THIS BOT WILL VERY OBVIOUSLY GET YOU CLOWNED ON. IT DOES NOT HAVE A SINGULAR FUNCTION TO NUKE EVERYTHING. THIS IS MADE AS A TEST AND DOES NOT HAVE ANY CHECKS TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE AUTHORIZED - ONLY `>test allowed` WILL CHECK IF YOU ARE SPECIFIED IN THE CODE. DO NOT REPUBLISH THIS CODE WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION FROM `@p.fr` ON DISCORD! [Join Peretas Technologies on Discord to learn more about our projects and updates](https://discord.gg/peretas)
